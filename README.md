# nxtOSEK-Setup-Guide-2015-
I've found that most installation guides for nxtOSEK (Lego Mindstorms NXT) are incomplete. This one is working as of 11/09/2015

Since you have to download about 6 things and put them everywhere (this is by far the most complicated install I've done),
I've created a zip file of all that you need.

NOTE. My nxtOSEK version is not up to date. The newest version is 300 and I'm on 214b3 (that was what popped up on sourceforge first)

Inside the zip file is a readme file. Follow installation method carefully.
